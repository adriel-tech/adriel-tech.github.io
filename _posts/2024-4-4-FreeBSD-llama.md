title: "FreeBSD - Setup simple local llamafile AI"

I've been playing with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) on my laptop and server for awhile.
I was actually writing up a guide for using it on my FreeBSD server through a nixos VM using podman. The truth was the
performance was poor, the container did not use its alloted ram properly, and cpu usage was pinned.

I then found[llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile) which is based on [cosmopolitan](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan)
and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Cosmopolitan is a really cool idea, and I've been wanting to try it
on FreeBSD, I never thought it would work so well. Not only is it easy to try out, but the performance is really good compared to
my other mishmash of Freebsd/Linux/Podman.

Below are simple instructions to get llamafile up and running:


```
fetch https://huggingface.co/jartine/llava-v1.5-7B-GGUF/resolve/main/llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile /tmp/
```

```
cd /tmp
```

```
chmod +x llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile
```

```
./llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile -ngl 9999
```

We just downloaded the llama, chmod and executed it. The llama's web interface will be at localhost:8080. To push it into my local network,
I nginx reverse proxy localhost:8080. I'll post the basic gist of my proxy, learning nginx is your resonsiblity üòù.

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    #    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    server_name ai.localdomain;

    location / {
        client_max_body_size 512M;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
Here is our wonderful derpy AI talking to a user on the local network.
